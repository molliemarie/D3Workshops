# Let's build a bar plot!

We'll be creating our first bar plot using Chicago crime data, which is available on the [Chicago Data Portal](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-present/ijzp-q8t2). For creation of this plot, I have aggregated the data to find the total counts of each type of crime for each year. (See ipython notebook where I did this [here](data/transformChiCrimeData.ipynb).) Before getting started, open the data file (`ChiCrime.csv`) to see how the data is structured.

We're going to create a bar plot, showing the counts of each crime in Chicago. It will end up looking something like this:

TKTK: change starter steps.

And, here we go!

**Note:** Since [Mike Bostock](https://bost.ocks.org/mike/) (creator of d3.js) doesn't technically make valid HTML pages, we're not going to either â€” here's how we'll start our own empty HTML pages from here on out:

  ```
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <meta charset="utf-8">

  <style type="text/css">
    /*css to go here*/
  </style>

  <body></body>

 <script src="https://d3js.org/d3.v4.min.js"></script>
 
  <script>
    //JS to go here
  </script>

  ```
