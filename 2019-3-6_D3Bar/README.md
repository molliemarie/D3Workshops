# Let's build a bar plot!

We'll be creating our first bar plot using Chicago crime data, which is available on the [Chicago Data Portal](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-present/ijzp-q8t2). For creation of this plot, I have aggregated the data to find the total counts of each type of crime for each year. (See ipython notebook where I did this [here](data/transformChiCrimeData.ipynb).) Before getting started, open the data file (`ChiCrime.csv`) to see how the data is structured.

We're going to create a bar plot, showing the counts of each crime in Chicago. It will end up looking something like this:

TKTK: change starter steps.

And, here we go!
